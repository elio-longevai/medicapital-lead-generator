You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to parse the following unstructured text, which describes an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), and convert it into a structured JSON object. The ICP focuses on both suppliers/manufacturers and end-users of equipment.

Focus on extracting these key fields:
- sectors: A list of primary industries (e.g., "Healthcare", "Sustainability", "Hospitality").
- target_entities: A list of company types (e.g., "Suppliers", "Installers", "Private Clinics", "Restaurants").
- geo_focus: The primary countries of operation (e.g., "NL", "BE").
- key_products: A list of relevant equipment or product types (e.g., "Ultrasound devices", "Solar panels", "Kitchen robotics").
- financial_criteria: A summary of financial health indicators mentioned.
- scale_indicators: Information on company size (e.g., "< 10 employees").
- investment_range: The typical value range of the equipment being financed.
